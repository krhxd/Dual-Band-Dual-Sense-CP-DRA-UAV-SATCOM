# Dual-Band-Dual-Sense-CP-DRA-UAV-SATCOM
Designed a Dual-Band Dual-Sense CP Dielectric Resonator Antenna using CST Studio with a unique "Swastik"-shaped ground plane. Analyzed S11, Axial Ratio, Directivity, Far-field, E-field, and H-field, performing parametric studies on substrate height, feed width, and ground plane dimensions for UAV satellite communication.
